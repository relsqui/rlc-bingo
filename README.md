Play on https://relsqui.github.io/rlc-bingo/
* Tap a square to place or remove a marker
* Refresh to get a new card

## Contributing

### Code

* Bingo functionality is in [card.jsx](src/card.jsx)
* Styles are in [styles.css](src/styles.css)
* The list of items is in [items.json](src/items.json)

#### How do I suggest something?

* With a GitHub account, you can hit "edit" on the [item list](src/items.json)
  * "Commit changes" when you're done and follow the prompts to make a fork and pull request
  * Don't worry about messing anything up, I'll review these
* Or just ping Relsqui in the Roguelike Celebration social space with requests

#### What makes a good suggestion?

* It _could_ come up in many different talks (seminal games and mechanics, but not really specific content elements)
* It won't _necessarily_ appear in any given talk (randomness and roguelikes are gimmes!)
* It fits on the card (aim for about as long as the existing items)
